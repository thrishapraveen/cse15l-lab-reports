Keys pressed to get to this step: ssh tpraveen@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu `<enter>`, then: cs15lwi24 `<enter>`

Summary of command and effect of keypresses: These steps allowed me to log into my ieng6 machine (without a passcode) and work on a specific course. 

Step 5:

Keys pressed to get to this step: git clone git@github.com:thrishapraveen/lab7.git `<enter>`

Summary of command and effect of keypresses: Since my SSH key is connected to my GitHub account, I can clone the repository I forked to my GitHub to my ieng6 machine using `git clone` on the SSH key from GitHub for the repo of interest. This will allow me to make changes to the cloned directory from the command line. 

Step 6:

Keys pressed to get to this step: ls `<enter>`, then: cd lab7/ `<enter>`, then: bash test.sh `<enter>`

Summary of command and effect of keypresses: The `ls` command helps me see where I am in the directory. The output being the `lab7` directory prompted me to `cd` into that directory to run the bash script. I then ran the bash script that compiles the relevant files and runs the test file using the `bash` command on the `test.sh` file. This will allow me to see whether the tests failed or not. As seen in the screenshot, both tests that were in the `ListExamplesTests` file failed, as expected.
