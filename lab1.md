## command `cd`
1. An example of using the command with no arguments:![Image](cd_Example1.png)

Working directory: `\home`

Why I got this output: The command `cd` requires an argument, which would specify what directory to change to, and if there's no argument, the directory can't be changed since no new directory is specified. The command `cd` anyways doesn't output anything however. 

Error: none
